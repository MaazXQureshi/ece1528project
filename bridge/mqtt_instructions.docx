Actuators Data:
For each bottle, the data is sent when there is a change in the data on the cloud on the 
topic MQTT_Actuator_Data_"bottle_id" where bottle_id is 1 or 2.
The data is in JSON format:
{
    "threshold": float,
    "cleaning": int (0 or 1)
} There is no need for identifier here since the topic identifies the bottle.

Sensors Data:
For each bottle, the data is sent on the topic MQTT_Sensor_Data.
The data is in JSON format:
{
    "initialMessage": bool
    "bottle_id": int (1 or 2),
    "volume": float,
    "roll": float,
    "pitch": float,
    "yaw": float,
    "temperature": float
}

The bottle is registered by the MQTT client once the bottle publishes a message to the topic MQTT_Sensor_Data with "initialMessage" field true. After that
the MQTT client sends actuator data periodically from the cloud to the MQTT broker in the specific topic of the water bottle.
